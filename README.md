This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Plant-Do
Plant-Do is a task management tool inspired by Bullet Journaling to help our overwhelmed “monkey brains” focus on today. I built this app to apply what I learned from *The Complete React Developer Course* on [Udemy](Udemy) and learn more about React Hooks and Context API.
